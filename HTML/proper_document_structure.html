<!-- MP3 format is widely used everywhere, but it is not an open format. What this means is that browsers can't decode MP3 files without paying a fee. This fee is not a big deal for big companies such as Apple, but it is a big deal for smaller companies such as Mozilla. This is why Safari will play back MP3 files while Firefox will not.

The Vorbis codec, usually delivered as a  .ogg file, is an open format. Firefox supports Ogg Vorbis, but Safari doesn't.
Chrome supports both formats. Fortunately, there is a way to use the audio element to support all browsers that support the audio element.
A browser that can play back Ogg Vorbis files will look no further than the first source element.
A browser that can play MP3 files will skip over the first source element and play the file in the second source element.

FAQ: How do I know if my HTML is valid?
You can (and should!) use http://validator.w3.org/ to verify your HTML.

What is the difference between an id attribute and a name attribute?
• The id attribute identifies your element for the front-end (CSS and JavaScript.) It can be used on ANY element.
• The name attribute belongs ONLY on form elements and is used in the back-end (PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc.) to identify your form's values.
