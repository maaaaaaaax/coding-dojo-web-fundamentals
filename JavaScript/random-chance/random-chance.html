    Let's play the slots!

    Make a function that takes a number of quarters (1 quarter = 1 game).

    There is a 1 in 100 chance to win the slot machine (which will give you between 50 - 100 quarters ... use Math.random and Math.floor to pick a random number of coins).

    While the user still has quarters, use Math.random to determine if they won.

    If they ever win, return the number of quarters (ex: they had 50 remaining quarters and won 90, so it should return 140).

    Return 0 if all the quarters were wasted.

    -->
    <script>
      "use strict";
      var quarters = 0;
      var a = 0;
      var b = 1;
      var reward = 0;
      var wallet = 0;

      // a = (Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100)) + 1;
      //
      // b = (Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100)) + 1;

      console.log("Welcome to Random Chance! Call function randomChance(x); by inputting a number between 50 and 100 to test your luck!");

      function randomChance(quarters)
      {
        while (quarters > 0)
        {
          // decrement quarters by one to start the game

          quarters = quarters - 1;

          console.log("Credits left: ", quarters);

          console.log("Spinning the slots...");

          // generate two random numbers between 1 and 10

            a = (Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100)) + 1;

            b = (Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100)) + 1;

            // check for equality - if true, return a random number of quarters from 50 - 100

            if (a == b)
            {
              reward = (Math.trunc(Math.random() * 50)) + 50;

              console.log("Congrats! You won ", reward, "quarters!");

              wallet = quarters + reward;

              return wallet;
